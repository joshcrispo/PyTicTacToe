# PyTicTacToe
This is a short little summer project. I created as I became really interested in python/programming concepts. Here, I use string variables to print the game plain and using string slicing am able to update the game plain layout. Also, I made arrays list to keep track of the areas in the plain already used, preventing overlaps.
